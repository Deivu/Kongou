## About this Bot
Kongou is an open source Discord Bot, using the library Eris. I purely maintain this code as a hobby when I want to rest on working with Kashima. 

Can be used as framework or extend it on your own, your choice. Right now, she is online in Kashima's home (refer to Kashima's repo for server invite links if you want to see it for yourself).

## Selfhosting?
All you need is

1. You need a Bot Application from Discord

2. Google API key.

3. A server where you can put this bot.
