# Kirishima

***[WIP]***
A pretty bare Discord music bot base (forked from @Deivu/Kongou).

*Please, for the sake of almost everything holy, disregard this repository. It's mostly intended for personal use of a self-hosted music bot on my Discord servers, and will most likely not cover your own needs, nor supersede in any way the original project. If any, you should be using [Kongou](https://github.com/Deivu/Kongou).*

**Sample README is included from the original Kongou repository**

> A simple bot to show how I use [Shoukaku](https://github.com/Deivu/Shoukaku) & [Azuma](https://github.com/Deivu/Azuma) on your Discord.JS bot

> PS. this supports sharding out of box due to `Azuma`

### Before you start 

> Make sure you have Node >=16.6.0 installed on your system as this uses Discord.JS v13

> Your own instance of [Lavalink](https://github.com/freyacodes/Lavalink/tree/dev), You can download the binaries at their [CI Server](https://ci.fredboat.com/viewType.html?buildTypeId=Lavalink_Build&branch_Lavalink=refs%2Fheads%2Fdev&tab=buildTypeStatusDiv)

> Some knowledge on filling the `config_templates` correctly

### If you want to selfhost this 

> Clone, then Download this repo to a work directory of your choice.

> Fill in the `config_templates` then drag them beside the index.js in your working directory

> Do `npm i` in your working directory

> Do `npm run slash` to get the slash commands updated for your bot

> Then do `npm start` to start the bot

### If you want to contribute just submit a PR.
